# Understanding MCP (Model Context Protocol)

## Overview
The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is a standardized way for AI models to interact with external tools and services. It separates the concerns of providing context from the actual LLM interaction.

## Key Concepts

### 1. MCP Server Architecture
- Servers expose functionality through a standardized protocol
- Similar to web APIs but specifically designed for LLM interactions
- Can provide:
  - Resources (like GET endpoints)
  - Tools (like POST endpoints)
  - Prompts (templates for LLM interactions)

### 2. Server Implementation
```python
from mcp.server.fastmcp import FastMCP

# Create an MCP server
mcp = FastMCP("Server Name")

# Define resources (data providers)
@mcp.resource("data://{id}")
def get_data(id: str) -> str:
    return f"Data for {id}"

# Define tools (actions)
@mcp.tool()
def perform_action(param: str) -> str:
    return f"Action performed with {param}"
```

### 3. Running MCP Servers
There are three main ways to run an MCP server:

1. **Development Mode**
   ```bash
   mcp dev server.py
   ```
   - Uses MCP Inspector for testing
   - Supports hot reloading
   - Can add dependencies with --with flag

2. **Claude Desktop Integration**
   ```bash
   mcp install server.py
   ```
   - Installs server for use with Claude
   - Can specify environment variables
   - Can customize server name

3. **Direct Execution**
   ```bash
   python server.py
   # or
   mcp run server.py
   ```
   - For custom deployments
   - More control over execution

### 4. Dependency Management
- MCP servers can specify their dependencies
- Can use `uv` for dependency management
- Dependencies can be specified:
  1. In the server code using `#! dependencies` comments
  2. Via command line with `--with` flag
  3. Through the FastMCP constructor

### 5. Integration with Windsurf/Cascade
- MCP servers are registered in `mcp_config.json`
- Each server entry specifies:
  - Command to run the server
  - Arguments and environment variables
  - Server-specific configuration

## Best Practices

1. **Server Organization**
   - Keep servers focused and single-purpose
   - Use clear resource and tool naming
   - Provide good documentation in docstrings

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Use inline dependency specifications when possible
   - Keep dependencies minimal and specific
   - Consider using virtual environments for isolation

3. **Error Handling**
   - Provide clear error messages
   - Handle both expected and unexpected errors
   - Log important information for debugging

4. **Testing**
   - Use development mode for testing
   - Test both resources and tools
   - Verify error cases

## Implementation Notes for Our YouTube MCP

Based on this understanding, our YouTube MCP server should:

1. Use the FastMCP server correctly (which we are)
2. Specify dependencies inline (which we've started)
3. Run without requiring package installation
4. Register properly in the MCP configuration

Next steps should focus on:
1. Testing the server in development mode
2. Verifying dependency management
3. Ensuring proper integration with Windsurf/Cascade
